Tool to configure Percom Block Drives. This Tool can be used to test Disk integrity and to format all kind of 
different Disk Formats available for Atari Disk Drives. 

Needs ACTION! Runtime package to compile a standalone Version. Disk with Source and compiled Version attached.

I wrote this Tool to configure the HDI 3 1/2" Disk drive designed by Erhard PÃ¼tz (aka FloppyDoc)
